            When submitting a PR, please follow these guidelines:

            - Include a short demo video showcasing the UI and any relevant edge-case testing. This makes the review process significantly faster.
            - Avoid unnecessary AI-generated comments or overly obvious code comments. Code should be self-explanatory whenever possible. Add comments only when implementing a workaround, a non-obvious solution, or something that will genuinely help future developers understand the context.  

            Quality is our top priority. We don’t optimize for speed if it compromises stability or introduces bugs.
